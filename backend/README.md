# Git Visually Backend

This directory contains the backend service for **Git Visually**, a tool that uses Generative UI to visualize Git repositories.

## Purpose

The backend is responsible for:
1.  **Cloning**: Retrieving public Git repositories.
2.  **Analysis**: Traversing the file system of the cloned repository.
3.  **Metadata Extraction**: Parsing files to extract functions, classes, dependencies, and file metadata.
4.  **Data Serving**: Providing a structured JSON representation of the repository to the frontend for visualization.

## Architecture

The backend is built with **Python** and is designed to be lightweight and fast.

### Key Components

*   **`src/api.py`**: The entry point for the API. Handles HTTP requests (likely via FastAPI or similar lightweight framework) to trigger analysis.
*   **`src/cloner.py`**: Handles git operations, specifically cloning repositories to a temporary directory for analysis.
*   **`src/analyzer.py`**: Orchestrates the analysis process, combining file traversal with metadata extraction.
*   **`src/file_processing.py`**: Contains the core logic for parsing different file types (supports multiple languages) and extracting relevant code entities (functions, classes, imports).

## `Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `uv` (recommended for dependency management) or `pip`

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    # OR
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Server

Start the development server:

```bash
uv run src/api.py
# OR
python src/api.py
```

The API will typically run on `http://localhost:8000` (check `src/api.py` for exact configuration).

## 🔗 Integration with Frontend

This backend serves as the **Data Provider** for the frontend's Generative UI. The JSON output generated by `analyzer.py` is consumed by the frontend's **Tambo AI** integration to intelligently select and populate visualization components.
